# elm-city-stories-educational-game-data-analysis
Elm City Stories, created by Play2Prevent lab at Yale School of Medicine, is an educational game that aims to identify teenagers who may need help in the future based on their performance in the game. This data analysis evaluates the game’s ability to understand and predict potential drug usage by correlating participants’ performance in the drug-related aspects of the game with their S5 survey result, which indicates their ability to resist drugs in the real world. We realized the “Dunning-Kruger Effect” and the “Imposter Syndrome” might play a role in the correlation study, and the S5 survey might have reliability issues. 


**Note**: Data from the Play2Prevent lab are not public. These data are proprietary and are only to be used for the purposes of the American Statistical Association’s DataFest.
I cannot publish the results of my analysis of the data except for the final products of the competition (slide deck and one-page summary).
